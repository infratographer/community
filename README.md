#  Community

## Community Meeting

The community meeting will be held on Thursdays at 10:30 am CT. This is flexible to the needs of the community and may change in the future.

You can expect updates from SIGS, project status, and open discussion. This is the best way to get involved with the project and stay up to date with the latest developments.

As the project develops and grows we will seek out tooling to help automate these interaction points and make them more accessible to the community. But for now, we have limited time and resources.
